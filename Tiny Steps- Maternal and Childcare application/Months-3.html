                What Can a 1 Year Old Baby Say?
                Speech development is very exciting for parents as they watch their babies become social beings that can interact with others. While every baby develops speech at his or her own rate, the following are some of the common milestones in this age group:

                By about 18 months of age, children begin to understand symbols – the relationship of objects and their meanings. While children may progress at different rates, the following are some of the common milestones children may reach in this age group:
                
                Waves bye-bye and plays pat-a-cake
                By 18 months understands one-step questions and commands such as “Where is the ball?”
                By 24 months understands two-step questions and commands such as “Go to your room and get your shoes.”

                Understands the cause-and-effect relationship better
                Likes to explore drawers and boxes to see what is inside
                Make-believe play increases (i.e., may imitate housework or feed a doll)
                Recognizes own face in mirror
