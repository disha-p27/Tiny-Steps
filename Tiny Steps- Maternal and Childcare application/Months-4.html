            3-Year-Old Developmental Milestones
            To help understand your 3-year-old‘s development, doctors use certain milestones to tell if your child is developing as expected. There is a wide range of what is considered normal, so some children gain skills earlier or later than others. Toddlers who were born prematurely may reach milestones later. Always talk with your doctor about your child’s progress.
            
            Children at this age love to play games of make-believe. However, their imaginations can sometimes run away with them and even spook them. Listen to your child’s fears and be there to comfort and reassure him or her when needed. There are many other 3-year-old developmental areas and milestones that will be reviewed in this article.

                How Much Will My 3-Year-Old Child Grow?
                In 3-year-olds, growth is still slow compared to the first year. Most children have become slimmer and lost the rounded tummy of a toddler. While all children may grow at a different rate, the following indicate the average for 3-year-old boys and girls:
                
                Weight: average gain of about 4 to 6 pounds per year
                Height: average growth of about 2 to 3 inches per year
                After age 2, children of the same age can noticeably vary in height and weight. Although kids come in all shapes and sizes, a healthy toddler should continue to grow at a regular pace. The doctor will measure and weigh your child at routine checkups and plot the results on a growth chart. This lets the doctor track your child’s growth over time and spot any trends that need attention. As long as your child is maintaining his or her own rate of growth, there should be no reason to worry. A consultation with your child’s pediatrician is recommended if there is cause for concern.
                s your child continues to grow, you will notice new and exciting abilities that your child develops. While children may progress at different rates, the following are some of the common milestones children may reach in this age group:

                4-year-olds:
                
                Sing songs
                Skip and hop on one foot
                Catch and throw a ball overhand
                Walk downstairs alone
                Draw a person with three separate body parts
                Build a block tower with 10 blocks
                Understand the difference between fantasy and reality
                Draw a circle and square
                Dress themselves
                Able to fasten large buttons without help
                Pull up a zipper after it is fastened
